Banks collect loan data through various channels and processes, including:
Loan Applications: When individuals or businesses apply for loans, they submit detailed applications that include personal and financial information. This data is collected electronically or in paper form.
Credit Reports: Banks often access credit reports from credit bureaus when assessing a borrower's creditworthiness. These reports contain information about a person's credit history, existing loans, and payment behaviour.
Internal Records: Banks maintain internal records of loan transactions, including disbursements, repayments, and loan status changes. These records are generated and stored in the bank's database.
Online Portals: Many banks offer online platforms where borrowers can apply for loans, make payments, and access account information. Data from these portals is collected and stored for analysis.
Third-party Data Sources: Some banks may use external data sources, such as income verification services, to gather additional information about borrowers.


Loan Application:
The process begins when a customer submits a loan application to a bank or lending institution. This application can be submitted in person, online, or through other channels.
Application Review:
The lending institution reviews the loan application and collects necessary documentation, such as income statements, credit reports, and identification documents.


Identity Verification:
One of the initial checks is to verify the applicant's identity. This helps ensure that the applicant is who they claim to be and prevents identity theft.
Credit Check:
A crucial step is to perform a credit check on the applicant. This involves accessing their credit report from credit bureaus. Lenders evaluate the applicant's credit history, credit score, and any past delinquencies or defaults.
Income Verification:
Lenders assess the applicant's ability to repay the loan by verifying their income. This may involve reviewing pay stubs, tax returns, or other income documentation.
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) Check:
Lenders calculate the applicant's DTI, which is the ratio of their monthly debt payments to their monthly income. A lower DTI indicates better repayment capacity.
Employment Verification:
Lenders may contact the applicant's employer to verify their employment status and length of employment. Stable employment history is often seen as a positive factor.
Collateral Assessment (if applicable):
If the loan is secured by collateral, such as a home or a car, the lender evaluates the value and condition of the collateral.
Risk Assessment:
Lenders assess the overall risk associated with the loan. This includes considering the applicant's credit risk, income stability, and the purpose of the loan.
Loan Approval or Denial:
Based on the information gathered and the risk assessment, the lender makes a decision to approve or deny the loan application. If approved, the lender determines the loan amount, interest rate, and terms.
Loan Agreement:
If the loan is approved, the lender provides the applicant with a loan agreement that outlines the terms and conditions, including the interest rate, repayment schedule, and any fees.
